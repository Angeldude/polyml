<h2><font face="Arial"><strong>PolyML.SaveState structure</strong></font></h2>

<p>The <span class="identifier">PolyML.SaveState</span> structure provides a way 
  for a program to save changes without the expense of exporting and building 
  a new executable. Unlike the PolyML.export function which saves the complete 
  state it is possible with the functions in this structure to save just the modifications. 
  In addition it avoids the need for a linker which is needed to turn an exported 
  object file into an executable. Because only the modifications are saved a saved 
  state can only be loaded into the executable that created it.</p>
<PRE class="mainsig"><STRONG>structure</STRONG> SaveState:
<STRONG>sig</STRONG>
    <strong>val</strong> saveState : string -&gt; unit
    <strong>val</strong> loadState : string -&gt; unit
    <strong>val</strong> saveChild : string * int -&gt; unit
    <strong>val</strong> renameParent : {child: string, newParent: string} -&gt; unit
    <strong>val</strong> showHierarchy : unit -&gt; string list
    <strong>val</strong> showParent : string -&gt; string option
<strong>end</strong></PRE>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simple Saved State</font></h3>
<p>For many purposes the simple saved state is sufficient. This is created with 
  <span class="identifier">saveState</span> and loaded with <span class="identifier">loadState</span>.</p>
<PRE class="entrycode"><STRONG>val</STRONG> saveState : string -&gt; unit</PRE>
<div class="entrytext"> Saves the current state to a file whose 
  name is given as the argument. It saves the current values of all the mutable 
  data (i.e. refs and arrays) that were present in the executable together with 
  any other data that is now reachable from it</div>
<PRE class="entrycode"><STRONG>val</STRONG> loadState : string -&gt; unit</PRE>
<div class="entrytext"> 
  <p>Loads a saved state file. This overwrites any changes made before the load 
    with the contents of the load file. It does not affect mutables created since 
    the session began nor does it affect function arguments or local variables.</p>
</div>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hierarchical Saved States</font></h3>
<p>The single level saved state created by <span class="identifier">saveState</span> 
  contains all the data that is accessible by the program apart from immutable 
  data present in the executable. Hierarchical saved states extend this idea by 
  allowing a program to save only the data that is not present in a previously 
  loaded state. Saving a state that contains only the new data creates a &quot;<em>child</em>&quot; 
  of the existing saved state which is the &quot;<em>parent</em>&quot;. When the 
  child is loaded in a new session the parent must also be loaded in order to 
  provide the full state. Since the parent may itself be a child of another saved 
  state this forms a chain of related saved states. A particular parent may have 
  several children depending on it. When <span class="identifier">loadState</span> 
  is called with a file name that refers to a child saved state it automatically 
  loads the parents using information held in each file.</p>
<p>The run-time system retains information about the last file that was loaded 
  or saved and its parents. The information is updated whenever loadState, saveState 
  or saveChild are called.</p>
<PRE class="entrycode"><strong>val</strong> showHierarchy : unit -&gt; string list</PRE>
<div class="entrytext"> 
  <p>Returns a list of the file names in the current hierarchy. The first item 
    in the list is the top-most saved state, the next is the immediate child of 
    that state and so on. The last item will be the file name that was actually 
    given as argument to <span class="identifier">loadState</span>, <span class="identifier">saveState</span> 
    or <span class="identifier">saveChild</span>.</p>
</div>

<PRE class="entrycode"><STRONG>val</STRONG> saveChild : string * int -&gt; unit</PRE>
<div class="entrytext"> 
    
  <p><span class="identifier">saveChild (f, n)</span> writes out a saved state 
    to file name f at hierarchy level n. n may be between zero and the current 
    hierarchy level, inclusive. <span class="identifier">saveState(f)</span> is 
    equivalent to <span class="identifier">saveChild(f, 0)</span>. Typically, 
    <span class="identifier">saveChild</span> will be called with a new file name 
    and a value for n which is the length of the current hierarchy list. This 
    will make a new child which contains only the information added since the 
    last call to <span class="identifier">loadState</span>, <span class="identifier">saveState</span> 
    or <span class="identifier">saveChild</span>. However, it is possible to use 
    a different value and this will cause the saved state to include data from 
    other saved states of the same or deeper hierarchy.</p>
</div>

<PRE class="entrycode"><strong>val</strong> renameParent : {child: string, newParent: string} -&gt; unit
<strong>val</strong> showParent : string -&gt; string option</PRE>
<div class="entrytext"> 
  <p>A child saved state contains the file name of its parent so that when the 
    child is loaded the parent can be loaded automatically. If the parent file 
    is moved for any reason <span class="identifier">renameParent</span> can be 
    used to modify the parent file name held in a child so that it can be loaded 
    from the new location. <span class="identifier">showParent</span> returns 
    the current value of the parent file name for a child saved state. If the 
    saved state has no parent <span class="identifier">showParent</span> returns 
    <span class="identifier">NONE</span>.</p>
</div>
  
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Comparison with the Persistent Store</font></h3>
<p>The persistent store of earlier versions of Poly/ML was similar to this in 
  that the <span class="identifier">commit</span> function saved only the changes 
  back to the database. There was also a <span class="identifier">make_database</span> 
  function that created a child database that contained only the changes from 
  the parent. There are a number of differences. A saved state is read and written 
  as a whole and is not locked once it has been read. As a rough equivalent <span class="identifier">commit</span> 
  and <span class="identifier">make_database</span> can be written as</p>
<PRE class="entrycode"><STRONG>fun</STRONG> commit() =
    <strong>let val</strong> h = PolyML.SaveState.showHierarchy()
    <strong>in</strong> saveChild(List.last h, length h - 1) <strong>end</strong>
<strong>and</strong> make_database f =
    <strong>let val</strong> h = PolyML.SaveState.showHierarchy()
    <strong>in</strong> saveChild(f, length h) <strong>end</strong>
</PRE>
<p>The definition of commit assumes that a saved state has already been loaded 
  and will fail if it has not.</p>
