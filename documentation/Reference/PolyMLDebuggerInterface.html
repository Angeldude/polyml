<H2><STRONG><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The PolyML.DebuggerInterface 
  structure</font></STRONG></H2>
<p>The PolyML.DebuggerInterface structure provides a programmatic interface to 
  assist with debugging programs. It is intended for use by applications that 
  replace the default Poly/ML top-level. Most users will not need to use this 
  and for most purposes the functions in <a href="../Debugging.html">PolyML.Debug</a> 
  will be more appropriate.</p>
<PRE><STRONG>structure</STRONG> DebuggerInterface:
  <strong>sig</strong>
     <strong>val</strong> setOnEntry = <strong>fn</strong>: (string * location -> unit) option -> unit
     <strong>val</strong> setOnExit = <strong>fn</strong>: (string * location -> unit) option -> unit
     <strong>val</strong> setOnExitException = fn: (string * location -> exn -> unit) option -> unit
     <strong>val</strong> setOnBreakPoint = <strong>fn</strong>: (location * bool ref -> unit) option -> unit

     <strong>type</strong> debugState
     <strong>val</strong> debugState = <strong>fn</strong>: Thread.Thread.thread -> debugState list
     <strong>val</strong> debugFunction = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -> string
     <strong>val</strong> debugFunctionArg = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -> PolyML.NameSpace.valueVal
     <strong>val</strong> debugFunctionResult = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -&gt; PolyML.NameSpace.valueVal
     <strong>val</strong> debugLocation = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -> location
     <strong>val</strong> debugNameSpace = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -> nameSpace
  <strong>end</strong></PRE>
<p>The Poly/ML compiler will add debugging information to a program if PolyML.Compiler.debug 
  is set to true or CPDebug true is included among the options. By default, these 
  options are turned off because using them greatly reduces the speed of the code 
  and in particular optimisations such as tail-recursion are disabled. When debugging 
  is enabled the compiler adds code to allow the debugger to be entered at various 
  points and for the debugger then to extract information about the state of the 
  program being debugged, the <em>debuggee</em>. </p>
<p>There are four global references that can be set by the debugger. Each of them 
  holds an optional function and the code being debugged tests these references 
  at various points in the program and calls the function if it is set.</p>
<pre><strong>val</strong> setOnEntry = <strong>fn</strong>: (string * location -> unit) option -> unit</pre>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The function set with setOnEntry is called at the start of every function. 
    This function is called with the name of the function and its location. It 
    is called after the argument information has been added to the debug state 
    but before anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><strong>val</strong> setOnExit = <strong>fn</strong>: (string * location -> unit) option -> unit</pre>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The function set with setOnExit is called at the end of every function if 
    it returns a result. This function is called with the name of the function 
    and its location. It is called after the function result has been added to 
    the debug state.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><strong>val</strong> setOnExitException = <strong>fn</strong>: (string * location -> exn -> unit) option -> unit</pre>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The function set with setOnExitException is called at the end of every function 
    if it is returning by raising an exception. This function is called with the 
    name of the function and its location and with the exception packet being 
    returned.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><strong>val</strong> setOnBreakPoint = <strong>fn</strong>: (location * bool ref -> unit) option -> unit</pre>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The function set with setOnBreakPoint is called at various <em>break-points</em> 
    within the function. Currently the compiler inserts break-points at the beginning 
    of the expression in a <em>match</em>, i.e. after the pattern has been discriminated 
    and any variable bindings have been made; after each value declaration; after 
    each expression separated by semicolons in let-expressions or parenthesised 
    sequence of expressions; at the beginning of the then- and else-parts of an 
    if-then-else and at the start of the body of a while-expression.</p>
  <p>The function is called with two arguments: the location of the break-point 
    and a break-point identifier, a boolean reference. Break-point identifiers 
    are intended for use with an IDE that is capable of examining the parse-tree. 
    A node in the parse-tree with a break-point associated with it will contain 
    a PTbreakPoint property. All break-point identifiers are initially false. 
    To set a break-point at a particular node the IDE should set the reference 
    to true and install a break-point function that calls the debugger when it 
    is passed a reference that is true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All functions are called by the thread that is running the program being debugged. 
  All the functions return unit and if they return normally the program will continue 
  as before. It is possible for the function to raise an exception in which case 
  this exception will be raised in place of any existing exception. This can sometimes 
  be useful to terminate the program. Installing any function will add an overhead 
  to the running program. It is better to set a function option to NONE if it 
  is not actually required.</p>
<p>When debugging is enabled the running program maintains information about local 
  variables that can be examined when the program has stopped by calling in to 
  the debugger.</p>
<pre><strong>type</strong> debugState
<strong>val</strong> debugState = <strong>fn</strong>: Thread.Thread.thread -> debugState list
</pre>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The stack of a debuggable thread can be extracted using the debugState function. 
    This should either be called by the thread itself or by the debugger after 
    the thread has been paused with a condition variable. Extracting the debugging 
    state of another thread while the thread is running will lead to unpredictable 
    results. </p>
</blockquote>
<pre><strong>val</strong> debugFunction = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -> string
<strong>val</strong> debugFunctionArg = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -> PolyML.NameSpace.valueVal
<strong>val</strong> debugFunctionResult = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -> PolyML.NameSpace.valueVal
</pre>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Each node in the state list normally represents a function. These return 
    the name of the function, its argument and its result. The result is only 
    available in an exit function.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><strong>val</strong> debugLocation = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -> location</pre>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This function returns the location associated with a node in the list. This 
    will either be the location of the break-point or where the function has called 
    the next function in the list.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>
<strong>val</strong> debugNameSpace = <strong>fn</strong>: debugState -> nameSpace</pre>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Access to the local variables can be obtained through the name-space. A name-space 
    is a record of functions that can be used to look up variables and list the 
    variables. In the general case it can also be used to add variables to the 
    name space but that is not appropriate here and the enter functions all raise 
    an exception. The name space can be used directly to print the values of variables 
    using functions from PolyML.NameSpace. Alternatively the name-space can be 
    used with the Poly/ML compiler to provide an interactive top-level in which 
    the user can enter expressions to be evaluated with local variables as though 
    they had been declared at the top-level. When paused at a break-point it is 
    possible to evaluate local functions as though they were global. Any changes 
    to local reference values will affect the program state when the program resumes.</p>
  <p>Currently, the name space contains all the variables that were in scope at 
    the break-point, both those local to the function itself and free variables 
    declared in outer scopes. It excludes any variables that were declared in 
    the outer top-level scope.</p>
